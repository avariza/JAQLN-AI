Challenge Overview: Creating an Intelligent Legal Advisory System for Traffic Violations
Our startup aims to enhance legal services related to traffic violations by deploying an AI system capable of providing accurate and insightful legal advice. Your challenge is to develop a prototype of an advanced legal advisory system leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques on traffic violation data.

## Requirements:
### 1. Technology Stack:
• Utilize Python as the primary programming language, with a focus on advanced NLP libraries such as spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, or other relevant tools.

• Jupyter notebook or Python script with code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

• You are not limited to the stack mentioned above. You can use Langchain along with other tools, such as a Conversational Retrieval QA chain.

• Propose a technology stack for deploying a scalable and efficient AI solution for processing and analyzing large-scale datasets like this one.

### 2. Dataset:
• We provide you with a dataset containing traffic violation records, including details such as the type of violation, location, and any legal outcomes. The dataset is available link below.

### 3. Tasks:
• Design and implement an NLP model capable of understanding legal queries related to traffic violations and generating coherent responses.

• Incorporate relevant legal knowledge from the traffic violation dataset to enhance the system's understanding and responsiveness.

• Evaluate the model's performance on a set of test queries related to traffic violations, emphasizing accuracy and relevance.


#### 1. Demographic Analysis (optional):
• Explore the demographic information of individuals involved in traffic stops (e.g., race, gender).

• Analyze if there are any patterns or biases in arrests based on demographics.

#### 2. Geospatial Analysis (optional):
• Visualize the geographic distribution of traffic stops on a map.

• Explore if there are any spatial patterns in violations or arrests.

#### 4. User Interface (Optional):
• If you choose to showcase your full-stack skills, you may create a user-friendly web interface allowing users to input traffic violation-related queries and receive AI-generated legal advice.

### 5. Documentation:
• Brief summary or report discussing insights, patterns, and any interesting observations.

• Include a README.md file in your submission with instructions on how to run your code and, if applicable, use the user interface.



### Evaluation Criteria:
1. Natural Language Understanding: The model's ability to comprehend and interpret legal queries related to traffic violations.

2. Contextual Responsiveness: The system's capacity to generate coherent and contextually relevant legal advice for traffic violations.

3. Model Performance: Evaluation metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of your NLP model, specifically tailored to traffic violation scenarios.

4. Code Quality: Organized, modular, and adhering to best practices in data science and NLP.

5. Documentation: Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for understanding your solution.
